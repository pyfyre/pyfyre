# A PyFyre App
Get started by modifying the [src/index.py](src/index.py).

Learn PyFyre by reading the [documentation](https://pyfyre.netlify.app/). It is also advisable to learn [Brython](https://www.brython.info/) alongside PyFyre as it is built on top of Brython.

### Deployment
Run `pyfyre build`. The build files are saved in the [build](build) directory so you can just serve or deploy that directory to the web.
